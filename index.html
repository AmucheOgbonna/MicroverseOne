              to
              Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different

              modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
              are
              not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.
              Long
